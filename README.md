# Rationale

I wanted to create the core components and structure of a working dashboard by creating a python app to server the database and connect to a web interface , By using a "MongoDB" in a "NoSQL" database to convert and present the third party information (DonorsChoose.org) in a JSON format and display it using D3.js.
